### Data and Labeling

CT axial images (n=238,151) from 1034 series were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive [1].  Eight body-parts were used as labels and were associated to each CT axial image: head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, thigh, crus and foot.  Amazon Web Service Mechanical Turk was used for data labeling and were given the following definition for the labels.

+ head: image containing the skull.
+ neck : between head and neck
+ chest: containing lung cavity.
+ abdomen: between chest and pelvis.
+ pelvis: containing pelvic bone.
+ thigh: between pelvis and crus.
+ crus: below mid-point of knee and above the ankle.
+ foot: presence of foot.

Review was done by the author, those that failed the above definition were sent to back to Mechanical Turk to relabel until all images passed the review bt the author.
